# Martian-Robot-Society

This is designed for a world with only robots. Their society involves a very strict hierarchy where every robot knows their place in society.

Tress are a fundamental data structure used to model all sorts of hierarchical data, so in this project, trees are used.

Run society_ui.py to see the result!!!
